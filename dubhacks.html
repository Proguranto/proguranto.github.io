									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p1>Project: Boundless Groceries, web application</p1>
                                    <p>Tools: ReactJS, HTML/CSS, Google Maps API</p>

									<p>I entered DubHacks '21, with my roommate and friend as we all wanted to try experience a hackathon together. I had a lot of fun during this event, trying to brainstorm different project ideas, learning new tools such as ReachJS, and the Google Maps API. Besides project building, we also had some other activities, we went to play pool, table tennis, mini soccer games, and also got some seoul bowl for dinner. This experience taught me how it feels like working on a computer science project together which differs so much from the CS intro classes we had at UW. This experience has definitely changed my perspective on how the work environment looks like for CS projects, and how I would love to so something like this in the future. In the end, we unfortunately weren't able to finish our project, but we made a lot of progress, learned new tools, and most importantly had a lot of fun!!</p>
