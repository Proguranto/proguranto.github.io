									<h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
									<p>Throughout this quarter, my goals and expectations have not changed one bit! I plan to continue pursuing as many opportunities as I can for this quarter such as applying to a research group, applying to become a TA, as well as applying for internships. Part of my goal for this quarter was to also become more socially interactive by joining different RSOs, applying for officer positions, and reaching out to different communities. Fortunately, I was able to get accepted into Husky Robotics, and also was able to have hangouts in a discord community I am a part of, we recently just had Friendsgiving.</p>

									<p>Something that has really surprised me this quarter is how much this journey has helped me learn more about myself and discover things I never realized I loved. Something that has always bothered me in college was what I wanted to do in the future, and what classes I should take in order to achieve that. However, the problem was that I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do. This quarter I was able to learn several things about myself, I realized that I enjoyed taking Math courses, how I found several concepts interesting, and the excitement I get from solving problems. This discovery has influenced me to steer my career interest in a field where I would be able to pursue Mathematics and its applications in Computer Science.</p>

									<p>UW was definitely not something I expected. I didn’t expect to have enjoyed it this much!! I enjoy the scenery as I walk around campus to get to class, the classes have been amazing, taught by wonderful Ph.D. students and professors, and the people here are amazingly kind and collaborative.</p>

									<p>Taking Honors 100 has taught me so much about the Honors Program. I was really interested in how the mission of the Honors Program is to teach students about the impact they can have socially in whatever career they choose. Especially for me as I haven’t really discovered what aspects of society I am interested in and how I can influence it. Something that I want to learn more about is the Study abroad program because I want to discover more about new cultures and also enjoy a new feeling in a new country, just as I am experiencing it right now.</p>

									<p>This quarter I have met a lot of my friends that I made over discord last year, and also made new friends in classes and outside activities. I have been able to learn about several different opportunities from them such as where I can find Research opportunities and how I can apply for them. I want to explore more about the different kinds of opportunities that I can find here at UW, especially if it’s related to something that I want to do in the future.</p>

									<p>At the end of my first year in Honors, I hope that I am able to build new connections with people from Honors Program, collect several new artifacts for my portfolio, discover and pursue different opportunities. As for the end of UW, I am not exactly sure what I want to get done by the end, but if I were to put it generally, I want to be the best version of myself as I continue to keep growing through multiple experiences.</p>

									<p>Describing me in this quarter: Discpline, Grit, Focusing on my progress, Growing, Learning, Build new connections/Networking.</p>
