									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>Entering my sophomore year, I was excited to finally be in campus for the first time!! and start dorming with my new roomates that I met over discord my first year. As an International student, it was definitely intimidating as I took my first steps in an unknown environment, but these experiences I had with my roommates have definitely helped me overcome these obstacles.</p>

									<p>I had several highlights with them included in the pictures below and many more, I had so much more fun and they have definitely made my college experience amazing!! I'm hoping to continue having even more extraordinary experiences with them as well as build new relationships with others!!!</p>
